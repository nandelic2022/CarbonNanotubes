These equations are obtained with GPSR algorithm using RHVS method to estimate the calculated atomic corrdiantes u_c,v_c, and w_C
using DFT.
After downloading define the functions as described in the paper. 
You should alos define the CubeRoot function in python script before executing the equations.
